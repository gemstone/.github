The [_Gemstone Libraries_](https://gemstone.github.io/root-dev/), maintained by the [Grid Protection Alliance](https://gridprotectionalliance.org/) (GPA), are a large collection of useful open source .NET code based on continuous development since [2004](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/gsf/graphs/contributors).

These libraries represent a focused re-envisioning of the best code, i.e., the _gems_, from the [Grid Solutions Framework](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/gsf) (GSF), which has long been in use by various open source projects and electric power utilities worldwide.

The Gemstone Libraries contain a large variety of code useful for any .NET project with of hundreds of class libraries that extend or expand the functionality provided with .NET, including many tools and protocol parsers that are useful for the electric power industry.
